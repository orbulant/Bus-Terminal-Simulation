# Bus-Terminal-Simulation
Using Java, a multithreaded bus simulation has been created that showcase threads and their abilities as well as the java.util.concurrent package utilities that can be used.

This assignment was graded an A+ (GPA 4.00) by Asia Pacific University Lecturer (Mr. Zailan Arabee was my direct lecturer).
